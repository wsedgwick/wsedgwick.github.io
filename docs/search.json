I work with researchers around the world to implement novel technologies to improve traditional survey methods. I am currently getting a Master in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School for Environmental Science and Management, UC Santa Barbara. With my degree, Iâ€™m hoping to improve survey method workflows so that the data collected can be analyzed with AI."
