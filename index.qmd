Welcome to my website!

I am a wildlife conservationist working with conservation organizations and government researchers around the world with the goal of improving wildlife survey methods through the implementation of drones. I have conducted drone surveys on a wide range of species, including southern sea lions, black-browed albatross, and critically-endangered freshwater turtles. I am currently getting a master's degree in Environmental Data Science to improve wildlife survey design post-processing, using AI software to automatically enumerate the thousands of individuals from the drone survey images.
